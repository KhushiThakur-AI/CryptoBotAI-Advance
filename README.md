If you want, I can **replace the generic “Architecture”** with one that specifically matches your **AI crypto bot** tech stack — Binance API, Google Sheets logging, Telegram manual trades, sentiment analysis, and async architecture — so the README is not just template-like but actually reflective of your real setup. That would make it much more professional and credible.
